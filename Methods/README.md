## Methods Folder
This folder is for the methods assignment due on 3/9/21, not the actual methods for the entire project.

This folder contains the R code that finds the Pearson Correlation Coefficient between interest rates and inflation as well as the data for both variables from the St. Louis Fed from 1960 to the present.
